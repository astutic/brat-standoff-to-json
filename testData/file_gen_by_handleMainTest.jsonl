{"Data":"Welcome to the Brat Rapid Annotation Tool (brat) tutorial!\n\nbrat is a web-based tool for structured text annotation and visualization. The easiest way to explain what this means is by example: see the following sentence illustrating various types of annotation. Take a moment to study this example, moving your mouse cursor over some of the annotations. Hold the cursor still over an annotation for more detail.\n\n\n1 ) Citibank was involved in moving about $100 million for Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of a former Mexican president, to banks in Switzerland.\n\n\nIf this example seems complicated, don't panic! This tutorial will present the key features of brat interactively, with each document presenting one or a few features. If you follow this brief tutorial, you'll be able to understand and create annotations such as those above in no time.\n\nTry moving to the next document now by clicking on the arrow to the right on the blue bar at the top left corner of the page.\n","Entities":[[418,426,"Organization"],[456,468,"Money"],[473,496,"Person"],[511,535,"Person"],[540,545,"Organization"],[549,560,"GPE"]]}
{"Data":"In brat, documents are organized into COLLECTIONS, like files are organized into directories (or folders) on your computer.\n\nWithin a single collection, you can move between different documents using the forward and backward arrows on your keyboard, or by clicking on the arrow buttons on the blue bar at the top left corner of the page, as you did just now.\n\nTo change collections or to jump straight to a specific document in a collection, you can use the COLLECTION BROWSER. The collection browser can be opened by moving the mouse cursor over the top bar to show the menu and clicking on \"Collection\", or by pressing the TAB key on your keyboard. To select a document in the collection browser, just double-click on it. To close the collection browser without changing documents, either click on \"Cancel\" or press the ESC key.\n\nIf at any time you get lost in this tutorial, you can use the collection browser to find your way back.\n\nNow that you know about navigation, the documents in this tutorial will no longer contain instructions about navigating between documents. When you finish reading a document (like now), just navigate to the next one.\n","Entities":[]}
{"Data":"Top bar and menu\n\nAs you may have already noticed, brat has a blue TOP BAR that opens the MENU when you place the mouse cursor over it. Once the mouse pointer leaves the menu area the menu will disappear, allowing more screen space for text and annotations.\n\nThe menu provides access to various dialogs for working with text and annotations, as well as a button for logging in in and out of brat.\n\nFinally, you should find a \"help\" link in the menu, which will open the brat manual in a separate page if clicked. You won't need the manual for this tutorial, but it may be helpful for reference later.\n","Entities":[]}
{"Data":"Logging in\n\nMany functions in brat, such as adding and changing annotations, can only be performed by users who are LOGGED IN.\n\nUser and password management is handled by the administrator of your brat installation. The remainder of this tutorial assumes that you have a username and password. If you do not have one already, this would be a good time to ask your brat installation administrator for this information.\n\nTry logging in and out now, and make sure you are logged in before proceeding with the tutorial.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nSome documents in this tutorial have a \"troubleshooting\" section like this at the bottom. These sections provide help for resolving possible issues following the instructions in the document. Feel free to skip over these sections unless you are having trouble with some of the instructions.\n\n* If the login fails to take effect, you may be blocking cookies. brat uses a cookie to detect if users are logged in, and you should allow this cookie to be set to use brat for annotation.\n\n* If you are administering the brat installation and don't know where to set usernames and passwords: edit the file config.py in the brat installation root using a text editor.\n\n","Entities":[]}
{"Data":"Text span annotation\n\nAnnotations marking a text span are a basic building block for most brat annotations. Examples of TEXT SPAN ANNOTATION are shown in the following sentence.\n\n\n1 ) Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in California.\n\n\nNote that in addition to identifying a span of text, each of these annotations also has a type. All brat annotations have some type, and the specific types used can be separately configured for each annotation project.\n\nText span annotations can be created simply by selecting text using the mouse, as in most text editors and similar software, selecting a type from the NEW ANNOTATION DIALOG that pops up after selection, and pressing OK (the dialog may look a bit complex, but you only need the \"Entity type\" selection and the \"OK\" button now). Try this now to create text span annotations for the following sentence!\n\n\n2 )  Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in California.\n\n\nIf you succeded in creating annotations so that above sentence looks like the first example, you can move to the next document. If you want to learn more or have some trouble with the annotation, see the \"hints\" and \"troubleshooting\" sections below.\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\nSome documents in this tutorial have a \"hints\" section like this. These sections provide additional information on how to use brat effectively. If you're only looking to understand basic usage, you can skip these sections.\n\n* Single words can be quickly selected for annotation by double-clicking.\n\n* If you want to select text but not annotate it (e.g. for copying it), hold down CTRL while selecting.\n\n* Multi-word spans can be quickly selected with two double-clicks by holding down CTRL during the first and SHIFT during the second double click.\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n* If you made some mistakes in annotation and don't know how to change them: see the instructions in the next document in this tutorial, and come back to try again.\n\n* If the second sentence was already annotated: please ask your administrator to reset the tutorial.\n\n* If nothing happens when selecting text: it may be that you are not logged in. Try clicking the rightmost button (\"Login\" button) in the menu.\n\n* If you get an error message like \"This document is read-only and can't be edited\": there is an issue with your brat installation. Please ask your administrator to check file permissions.\n","Entities":[[184,190,"Organization"],[206,216,"Person"],[221,232,"Person"],[236,246,"GPE"]]}
{"Data":"Editing text span annotations\n\nTo modify or delete text span annotations, double-click on the annotation (the \"box\" above the text). This will the EDIT ANNOTATION DIALOG, which is similar to the New Annotation dialog you saw when creating text span annotations.\n\nThe following sentence contains some extra annotations. Use the \"Delete\" button in the Edit Annotation dialog to remove these.\n\n\n1 ) This sentence contains no mentions of anything of interest and shouldn't have any annotations.\n\n\nThe annotations in the following sentence are otherwise OK, but their spans include some extra words. The move \"Move\" button in the Edit Annotation dialog allows you to move the spans to the right places. After clicking on Move, just select the correct span as you would when creating a new annotation.\n\n\n2 ) This sentence mentions some entities, but they are misannotated: Google was founded in California.\n\n\nYou can also change the type of an existing annotation in the Edit Annotation dialog by selecting a type, just like when creating a new annotation. Try it out on the sentence below.\n\n\n3 ) No matter what the annotation says, Google is an organization and not a person.\n\n\nThat's all you need for working with text span annotations! Next, let's move on to ways of associating annotations with other annotations.\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n* Note that the border of the brat annotation area will turn red while in the \"move annotation\" mode.\n\n* The ESC key can be used to cancel most active operations in brat. Pressing ESC will dismiss open dialogs and cancel \"Move\" operations.\n\n* When in the Edit Annotation dialog, the DEL key can be used to delete the annotation and the INS key to move it.\n\n* In the Edit Annotation dialog, the keys corresponding to the underlined characters in the type texts can be used to quickly select each type. (If nothing is underlined or you want to change the configuration, ask your administrator to edit the kb_shortcuts.conf file.)\n","Entities":[[401,409,"Person"],[434,442,"Organization"],[478,489,"GPE"],[867,877,"Organization"],[886,899,"GPE"],[1127,1133,"Person"]]}
{"Data":"Relation annotation\n\nThe simplest form of connection between annotations is a binary RELATION ANNOTATION. An example is shown below.\n\n\n1 ) Terry Pratchett lives in England.\n\n\nThe relation in the above example is directed: the annotation that the relation is \"from\" is distinguished from the annotation that the relation is \"to\". Another important category is symmetric, transitive relations, used for EQUIVALENCE RELATION ANNOTATION. This is illustrated in the sentence below.\n\n\n2 ) Joanne Rowling is also known as Jo Rowling and J. K. Rowling\n\n\nThe above annotation implies that the relation holds between all pairs in the \"chain\". (We'll skip more detailed explanations of this now.)\n\nRelation annotations can be created by clicking on an annotation \"box\" and dragging the mouse pointer to another annotation box. During the drag an arrow originating from the box that you started dragging from is shown, and the annotations that can be connected to are shown with thicker borders. If you release the mouse button when the arrow connects annotations that can be connected, a New Annotation dialog is shown for selecting the type of the relation.\n\nTry this now: create relation annotations for the next two sentences!\n\n\n3 ) Terry Pratchett lives in England.\n\n4 ) Joanne Rowling is also known as Jo Rowling and J. K. Rowling\n\n\nIf you succeeded in creating annotations so that the last two sentences match the first two, move on to the next document.\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n* Note that the annotation types shown in the New Annotation dialog vary depending on the annotations you are connecting. (The types of relations allowed are fully configurable.)\n\n* When no relation types are allowed by the configuration for a pair of annotations, the \"target\" annotation will be highlighted in red and the New Annotation dialog will not be shown.\n\n* The type selection in the New Annotation dialog for relation annotations can be configured to use keyboard shortcuts similarly to that for text span annotations.\n\n* Details on different categories of relations (symmetric, transitive) can be found in the brat documentation.\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n* If you can't create relation annotations, make sure that you are logged in and note that you have to single-click and hold the mouse button down (\"drag\") to create a relation annotation.\n","Entities":[[139,154,"Person"],[164,171,"GPE"],[483,497,"Person"],[515,525,"Person"],[530,543,"Person"],[1225,1240,"Person"],[1250,1257,"GPE"],[1264,1278,"Person"],[1296,1306,"Person"],[1311,1324,"Person"]]}
{"Data":"Editing relation annotations\n\nRelation annotations can be modified or deleted similarly to text span annotations, using the Edit Annotation dialog that is shown when double-clicking on the relation type.\n\nTo try this out: first, delete the extra relation annotations in the following sentences:\n\n\n1 ) Terry Pratchett has no particular association with Yokohama.\n\n2 ) Terry Pratchett and J. K. Rowling are certainly not the same person.\n\n\nIn the Edit Annotation dialog for relations, \"Reselect\" is similar to \"Move\" for spans. Try using this function to correct the annotation in the next sentence.\n\n\n3) Terry Pratchett lives in Buckinghamshire, which is near Oxfordshire.\n\n\nRelation annotation types can also be changed similarly to text span annotation types.\n\n\n4) Terry Pratchett lives in Buckinghamshire.\n\n\nEasy, isn't it?\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n* As in the Edit Annotation dialog for text span annotations, DEL and INS can also be used for deleting and re-selecting in the edit dialog for relation annotations.\n","Entities":[[301,316,"Person"],[367,382,"Person"],[352,360,"GPE"],[387,400,"Person"],[603,618,"Person"],[628,643,"GPE"],[659,670,"GPE"],[766,781,"Person"],[791,806,"GPE"]]}
{"Data":"Event annotation\n\nFor capturing associations of arbitrary numbers of annotations, brat implements a number of features supporting EVENT ANNOTATION: text-bound, n-ary associations of annotations. As this is a bit of a mouthful, let's us use some examples.\n\n\n1 ) The merger involved YouTube.\n\n2 ) YouTube merged with Google.\n\n3 ) Would you believe Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook merged?\n\n\nEach of the above sentences contains a single event annotation, with different numbers of participants. It may be helpful to think of a brat event annotation as a text span annotation together with binary relations identifying the participants in the event (this is a reasonable approximation of the actual representation). In many event annotation efforts, the text span annotation is termed the \"event trigger\" and the relation types \"participant roles\".\n\nIt is straightforward to create event annotations: first create a text span annotation and assign it an event type; then annotate the participants by dragging and dropping, just as for binary relations. Try to recreate the above event structures below.\n\n\n4 ) The merger involved YouTube.\n\n5 ) YouTube merged with Google.\n\n6 ) Would you believe Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook merged?\n\n\nThe trigger and event arguments can be edited just as any text span and relation annotation, using the same methods we learned in the previous parts of this tutorial. Try it out to correct the annotations below.\n\n\n7 ) WikiNews reports that Google and Facebook merged.\n\n\nThat's all there is to basic event annotation!\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n* Deleting the event annotation (the \"box\" identifying the trigger) deletes also all the relations identifying its participants.\n\n* When a single event involves multiple participants in the same role (relation type), the roles are differentiated by numeric suffixes (e.g. \"Org2\", \"Org3\"). This can be used to pair up event participants (e.g. \"Org2\" is associated with \"Loc2\"), but can be ignored in annotation efforts not involving such pairs.\n","Entities":[[281,288,"Organization"],[295,302,"Organization"],[315,321,"Organization"],[346,352,"Organization"],[354,359,"Organization"],[361,367,"Organization"],[373,381,"Organization"],[1129,1136,"Organization"],[1143,1150,"Organization"],[1163,1169,"Organization"],[1194,1200,"Organization"],[1202,1207,"Organization"],[1209,1215,"Organization"],[1221,1229,"Organization"],[1458,1466,"Organization"],[1480,1486,"Organization"],[1491,1499,"Organization"]]}
{"Data":"Structured event annotation\n\nOne important property of event annotation is the ability to annotate events as participants in other events, creating complex event structures. This allows the annotation to express, for example, that one event is the cause of another. Consider the following example:\n\n\n1 ) Wikinews reported that Google and YouTube merged.\n\n\nHere, one event is marked as participating in another. Such \"nesting\" can involve arbitrary depth:\n\n\n2 ) My friend told me that Reddit posted that Wikinews reported that Google and YouTube merged.\n\n\nThese annotations can be created using the brat functionality you are already familiar with: simply first create event annotations that do not involve other event annotations as participants, and then create the \"upper layers\" of annotation to make the full structure. Try this to reconstruct the examples above, and make sure you have all the details right!\n\n\n3 ) Wikinews reported that Google and YouTube merged.\n\n4 ) My friend told me that Reddit posted that Wikinews reported that Google and YouTube merged.\n\n\nIt may take a bit of practice to get used to \"reading\" event annotations such as these, but they're easy enough to understand once you've seen a few.\n","Entities":[[327,333,"Organization"],[338,345,"Organization"],[304,312,"Organization"],[461,470,"Person"],[484,490,"Organization"],[503,511,"Organization"],[526,532,"Organization"],[537,544,"Organization"],[920,928,"Organization"],[943,949,"Organization"],[954,961,"Organization"],[975,984,"Person"],[998,1004,"Organization"],[1017,1025,"Organization"],[1040,1046,"Organization"],[1051,1058,"Organization"]]}
{"Data":"Attribute annotation\n\nTo support the annotation of properties in more detail than just annotation type, brat supports ATTRIBUTE ANNOTATION. Attributes are either binary (on/off) flags or values selected from a set of possible alternatives.\n\nSome examples are shown in the following. Take a moment to study these by hovering over the annotations with the mouse cursor to see the information display, and then double-click to open the Edit Annotation dialog to see how the attributes are set.\n\n\n1 ) Somebody twitted that YouTube may merge with Google.\n\n3 ) A merger between YouTube and Google.\n\n4 ) CNN reports that YouTube has merged with Google.\n\n\nAs you may have noted earlier, there are separate controls under the annotation type selector for attributes. Try using these now to make the attribute settings for the following annotations match those above.\n\n\n1 ) Somebody twitted that YouTube may merge with Google.\n\n3 ) A merger between YouTube and Google.\n\n4 ) CNN reports that YouTube has merged with Google.\n\n\nAttributes can be set when creating a new annotation in exactly the same way that they can be set when editing an existing one.\n","Entities":[[497,505,"Person"],[519,526,"Organization"],[542,548,"Organization"],[572,579,"Organization"],[584,590,"Organization"],[597,600,"Organization"],[614,621,"Organization"],[638,644,"Organization"],[864,872,"Person"],[886,893,"Organization"],[909,915,"Organization"],[939,946,"Organization"],[951,957,"Organization"],[964,967,"Organization"],[981,988,"Organization"],[1005,1011,"Organization"]]}
{"Data":"Annotation notes\n\nAlthough brat is primarily oriented toward structured annotation that can be automatically interpreted, it also supports free-text NOTES that can be attached to annotations. Annotations with notes are emphasized with a visual highlight, and notes can be read either by hovering the mouse cursor over the annotation or by opening the Edit Annotation dialog. Some examples are shown below.\n\n\n1 ) Discworld is balanced on the backs of four elephants.\n\n2 ) YouTube and DoubleClick merged with Google.\n\n3 ) Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright were pioneers in aviation.\n\n\nTry out this functionality by adding some notes below.\n\n\n4 ) Discworld is balanced on the backs of four elephants.\n\n5 ) YouTube and DoubleClick merged with Google.\n\n6 ) Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright were pioneers in aviation.\n\n\nNotes can be useful for communicating between annotators collaborating on a single project or for leaving yourself reminders.
